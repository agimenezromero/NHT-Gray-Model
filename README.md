# Nanoscale Heat Transport - Gray Model approach
Python little library to simulate nanoscale hat transport from the Gray Model approach.

# Overview
The aim of this program is to simulate thermal transport at nanoscale. The method used is known as the Gray Model, which considers that phonon properties (shuch as energy, average velocity, average frequency...) are based only on local sub-cell temperature. 

Two simulation types have been implemented:

1. `GrayModel`: Considers specular reflection with the domain walls.
2. `GrayModel_diffusive_walls`: Considers diffusive reflection with the domain walls.
